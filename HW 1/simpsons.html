<img src="img/Homer.png" alt="Homer">
<p>Homer Jay Simpson (born May 12, 1956) is the main protagonist of The Simpsons series (or show). He is the spouse of Marge Simpson and father of Bart, Lisa and Maggie Simpson. Homer is overweight (said to be ~240 pounds), lazy, and often ignorant to the world around him. Although Homer has many flaws, he has shown to have great caring, love, and even bravery to those he cares about and, sometimes, even others he doesn't. He also serves as the main protagonist of the The Simpsons Movie.

    His favorite color is blue and he enjoys dancing, eating donuts, drinking, hugging, driving a sit-down arcade racer, playing the piano and horse riding. His favorite kiddie rides are "Stuart Little", "Barney Train" and "Ride the Champion Mechanical Horse".

    Homer works as a low-level safety inspector at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant in Sector 7G, although he is often incompetent and negligent towards his duties. He spends a great deal of his time at Moe's Tavern with his friends Barney Gumble, Carl Carlson, Lenny Leonard, and Moe Szyslak. At home, he can often be found sitting on the couch mindlessly watching TV while snacking on food and drinking Duff. Homer is also the only son of Abraham Simpson II and Mona Simpson. When provoked, he often strangles Bart for pressuring him. Even though he mutually hates his wife's sisters Patty and Selma Bouvier, he played Selma's husband for her to adopt Ling and agreed to be the minister for Patty's intended homosexual marriage. As a result of this, Homer is his legal adoptive father.

    Homer may just be a normal man, but he has had many great achievements and experiences in his life. He has won a Grammy, an Academy Award, a Pulitzer Prize, been to space and saved Springfield many times.

    Homer is named after Matt Groening's late father Homer Groening. In a series of interviews in 1990, Groening reportedly stated that he named the character after the Homer Simpson in The Day Of the Locust, a 1939 novel by Nathanael West according to Planet Simpson, but neither explanation is considered definitive.

<p>
    Bartholomew "Bart" Jojo Simpson (born April 1 or February 23) is the mischievous, rebellious, misunderstood, disruptive and "potentially dangerous" oldest child of the Simpson family in The Simpsons. He is the only son of Homer and Marge Simpson, and the older brother of Lisa and Maggie. He also has been nicknamed "Cosmo", after discovering a comet in "Bart's Comet". Bart has also been on the cover on numerous comics, such as "Critical Hit", "Simpsons Treasure Trove #11", and "Winter Wingding". Bart also has a 100-issue comic series entitled the Simpson Comics Presents Bart Simpson. Bart is loosely based on Matt Groening and his older brother, Mark Groening.

    Even at a young age, Bart has accomplished many feats. He has won an award for his Angry Dad web series[9], he has discovered a new comet which was named after him, and he also has performed in a successful band with Milhouse Van Houten, Nelson Muntz, and Ralph Wiggum.
